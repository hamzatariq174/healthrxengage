Historically, patients with certain drug-resistance patterns were  often treated for 20˜months or longer.

Subsequent modifications to these treatment  regimens led WHO to assess new evidence, which in turn resulted in revised recommendations,  balancing effectiveness and harms of new regimens or modifications of recommended regimens.
